=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.21.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.21.0 release and the 5.21.1
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.20.0, first read
L<perl5210delta>, which describes differences between 5.20.0 and 5.21.0.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 C<qr/foo/x> now ignores any Unicode pattern white space

The C</x> regular expression modifier allows the pattern to contain
white space and comments, both of which are ignored, for improved
readability.  Until now, not all the white space characters that Unicode
designates for this purpose were handled.  The additional ones now
recognized are
U+0085 NEXT LINE,
U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK,
U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK,
U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR,
and
U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

=head2 In double-quotish C<\cI<X>>, I<X> must now be a printable ASCII character

In prior releases, failure to do this raised a deprecation warning.

=head2 Splitting the tokens C<(?> and C<(*> in regular expressions is
now a fatal compilation error.

These had been deprecated since v5.18.

=head2 5 additional characters are treated as white space under C</x> in
regex patterns (unless escaped)

The use of these characters with C</x> outside bracketed character
classes and when not preceeded by a backslash has raised a deprecation
warning since v5.18.  Now they will be ignored.  See L</qrE<sol>fooE<sol>x>
for the list of the five characters.

=head2 Comment lines within S<C<(?[ ])>> now are ended only by a C<\n>

S<C<(?[ ])>>  is an experimental feature, introduced in v5.18.  It operates
as if C</x> is always enabled.  But there was a difference, comment
lines (following a C<#> character) were terminated by anything matching
C<\R> which includes all vertical whitespace, such as form feeds.  For
consistency, this is now changed to match what terminates comment lines
outside S<C<(?[ ])>>, namely a C<\n> (even if escaped), which is the
same as what terminates a heredoc string and formats.

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Using a NO-BREAK space in a character alias for C<\N{...}> is now
deprecated

This non-graphic character is essentially indistinguishable from a
regular space, and so should not be allowed.  See
L<charnames/CUSTOM ALIASES>.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

=item *

L<Carp> has been upgraded from version 1.3301 to 1.34.

Carp::Heavy now ignores version mismatches with Carp if Carp is newer
than 1.12, since Carp::Heavy's guts were merged into Carp at that
point.
L<[perl #121574]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121574>

=item *

L<Encode> has been upgraded from version 2.60_01 to 2.62.

B<piconv> now has better error handling when the encoding name is nonexistent,
and a build breakage when upgrading L<Encode> in perl-5.8.2 and earlier has
been fixed.

=item *

The libnet collection of modules has been upgraded from version 1.25 to 1.27.

There are only whitespace changes to the installed files.

=item *

=item *

L<Math::BigInt> has been upgraded from version 1.9993 to 1.9994.

Synchronize POD changes from the CPAN release.

C<< Math::BigFloat->blog(x) >> would sometimes return blog(2*x) when
the accuracy was greater than 70 digits.

The result of C<< Math::BigFloat->bdiv() >> in list context now
satisfies C<< x = quotient * divisor + remainder >>.

=item *

L<Math::BigRat> has been upgraded from version 0.2606 to 0.2607.

=item *

L<perl5db.pl> has been upgraded from version 1.44 to 1.45.

A mismatch between the documentation and the code in utf8::downgrade()
was fixed in favour of the documentation. The optional second argument
is now correctly treated as a perl boolean (true/false semantics) and
not as an integer.

=item *

fork() in the debugger under C<tmux> will now create a new window for
the forked process. L<[perl
#121333]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121333>

The debugger now saves the current working directory on startup and
restores it when you restart your program with C<R> or <rerun>. L<[perl
#121509]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121509>

L<Unicode::Collate> has been upgraded from version 1.04 to 1.07.

=item *

L<Unicode::Normalize> has been upgraded from version 1.17 to 1.18.

The XSUB implementation has been removed in favour of pure Perl.

=item *

L<Hash::Util> has been upgraded from version 0.16 to 0.17.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
